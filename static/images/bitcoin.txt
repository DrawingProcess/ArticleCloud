bitcoin: The numbers add up to a mountain of evidence that the Chinese government is engaged in a sophisticated campaign to thwart Bitcoin mining. The arrests show that the authorities see no distinction between legitimate and illegal activity. They view Bitcoin as a threat, just like they view foreign investment loans as a threat.

Our view is that any currency is going to have some inherent flaws. When we hear the term “free market,” we think of a system where there are no distortions — there’s no collusion, there’s no defrauding the government. What China is doing is very unusual in that it’s not trying to create some private market — it’s actually trying to crush the private market.

What do you make of the indictment itself?

It’s remarkable that after years of statements that the Chinese government was going to crack down on Bitcoin, that they actually do it. It’s very telling that the charges are not about the technology, but about the miners. It’s really striking that the charges are about the profits of the companies, not the individuals. It suggests that the real target is the profits of the miners, and not the individuals.

Does it make any difference to you that the money lost by these arrests is probably not even that much money?
michael schmidt
It’s not
